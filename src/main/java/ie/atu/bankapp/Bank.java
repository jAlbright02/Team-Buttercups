    //database function to compare against (James' Job)



    //create account - the code for this is basically already made just hold it in a function
    //take info - instead of a million print lines like i've left it as
    //store into database - already done by my Create() function

    //show balance (easy enough stuff)

    //withdraw

    //deposit

    //delete acc (done, just make the menu and i'll fix the function to fit how its made)
